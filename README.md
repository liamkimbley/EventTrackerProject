## Event Tracker

This is our second exposure to Spring REST technologies. For the initial project, we were required to make a simple database of our choosing and connect to it using Spring REST. As we learn JavaScript, we will come back and use that technology to build the front end. For now, we will verify that REST is working and connected properly to the database using Postman. We can use @Query to return specific results from the database, but we need to use Spring REST to perform the full CRUD operations.

### Update

After the first week of JavaScript, we are applying this technology to this project. The goal is to render a front end to allow a user to interact with the database. Using JavaScript, we are to capture the user's input and forward it to the REST framework already in place.

Completing the project in steps like this was to show how the front end is completely separate from the back end. Visualization is not a priority for this project. The primary objective is to understand how to tie these technologies together.
